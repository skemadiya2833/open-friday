## Updates

* **2026-07-22** — **Fara1.5 released!** A family of native computer use
  agents at three scales (Fara1.5-4B, Fara1.5-9B, Fara1.5-27B) built on
  Qwen3.5 and trained on data from the **FaraGen1.5** pipeline. **All three models have weights available on [Hugging Face](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-hf) and can be hosted through Microsoft Foundry ([Fara1.5-4B](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-4B-foundry), [Fara1.5-9B](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-9B-foundry), [Fara1.5-27B](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-27B-foundry))**.
  Fara1.5-9B
  reaches 63.4% on Online-Mind2Web and 86.6% on WebVoyager, a new state of
  the art for its size class; Fara1.5-27B achieves 72.3% on Online-Mind2Web,
  outperforming much larger proprietary systems. Read the
  [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.20785) and the
  [blog post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/fara1-5-computer-use-agent/).
* **2026-05-12** — **WebTailBench** is now a first-class benchmark in this
  repo: the loader auto-downloads tasks and rubrics from
  [`microsoft/WebTailBench`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/WebTailBench)
  (use the refreshed `test_v2` split; a V1↔V2 diff is hosted
  [here](https://microsoft.github.io/fara/docs/webtailbench_v1_v2_diff.html)),
  the **Universal Verifier** (`MMRubricAgent`) is the official judge, and the
  reproducibility CLI lives in `webeval/scripts/webtailbench.py` (stand-alone
  re-scoring via `webeval/scripts/verify_trajectories.py`).
* **2026-04-19** — Released **[CUAVerifierBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/CUAVerifierBench)**,
  a human-annotated benchmark for evaluating CUA verifiers (i.e. judges that
  score agent trajectories). Two splits — `fara7b_om2w_browserbase` (106
  Fara-7B Online-Mind2Web/Browserbase trajectories, ~2 reviewers each) and
  `internal` (154 trajectories from a heldout aurora-v2 task suite) —
  with per-judge UV-blind / UV-informed labels, Universal Verifier
  outputs, and legacy verifier outputs side-by-side. The build script
  that produced the dataset lives alongside the data on Hugging Face.

## Overview

**Fara1.5** is a family of native Computer Use Agents (CUAs) at three scales — **Fara1.5-4B**, **Fara1.5-9B**, and **Fara1.5-27B** — built on Qwen3.5 and trained with supervised finetuning on data from **FaraGen1.5**, our scalable data pipeline of environments, solvers, and verifiers. Each model sets a new state of the art for its size class on browser-use benchmarks, and Fara1.5-27B outperforms much larger proprietary systems such as OpenAI Operator and Gemini 2.5 Computer Use on Online-Mind2Web.

Fara1.5 models operate through an observe-think-act loop: given a screenshot of the browser and the conversation history, the model reasons about the state of the task and outputs an action — mouse and keyboard inputs on directly predicted coordinates, web searches, or context management operations — with no accessibility trees or separate parsing models.

<div align="center">
<img src="figures/fig2_fara_agentic_loop.png" alt="Fara1.5 Observe-Think-Act Loop" width="800"/>
</div>

All three models are available on Microsoft Foundry: [Fara1.5-4B](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/Fara1.5-4B), [Fara1.5-9B](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/Fara1.5-9B), and [Fara1.5-27B](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/Fara1.5-27B).

Try Fara1.5-9B as follows (see [Installation](#installation) for detailed instructions):

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fara.git
cd fara

# 2. Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install
```

Deploy Fara1.5-9B from the [Microsoft Foundry catalog](https://ai.azure.com/catalog/models/Fara1.5-9B) and put your endpoint in a config JSON (e.g. `azure_foundry_config.json`):

```json
{
    "model": "Fara1.5-9B",
    "base_url": "https://your-endpoint.inference.ml.azure.com/",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

Then you can iteratively query it with:
```bash
fara-cli --task "whats the weather in new york now" --endpoint_config azure_foundry_config.json
```

To try Fara inside Magentic-UI — a sandboxed browser environment with auditable action logging and user prompts at critical points — follow the instructions in the [Magentic-UI repo](https://github.com/microsoft/magentic-ui). You will need a model endpoint as before, but instead of fara-cli you can use Magentic-UI which has a nice UI (see video demos below).

Note: If you're using Windows, we highly recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Please see the Windows instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section.

### What Makes Fara1.5 Unique

Unlike traditional chat models that generate text-based responses, Fara1.5 leverages computer interfaces—mouse and keyboard—to perform multi-step tasks on behalf of users. The models:

- **Operate visually** by perceiving webpages and taking actions like scrolling, typing, and clicking on directly predicted coordinates without accessibility trees or separate parsing models
- **Enable efficient deployment** thanks to their compact sizes (4B/9B/27B), resulting in reduced latency and improved privacy
- **Interact with users**: trained with a user simulator on multi-turn rollouts, Fara1.5 can ask for missing information, flag ambiguous tasks, and pause for approval before irreversible actions
- **Remain a research preview**: safety measures include refusing harmful tasks based on responsible AI policies, prompting users at critical interaction points, and auditable action logging through Magentic-UI's sandboxed browser environment

### FaraGen1.5: Scalable Learning Environments

Collecting computer use data from human demonstrations is expensive and slow. **FaraGen1.5** is a scalable data pipeline composed of three modular components:

- **Environments** — open-internet tasks on live websites plus six synthetic FaraEnvs (Mail, Calendar, Stream, ML, Stay, Scheduler): functional UI clones that faithfully simulate domains gated by authentication or requiring irreversible actions, and unlock execution-based, ground-truth verification
- **Solvers** — a solver harness that can be powered by multiple models, including strong frontier models such as GPT-5.4, paired with a user simulator to enable multi-turn rollouts
- **Verifiers** — three complementary filters covering task correctness (the Universal Verifier LLM-judge), efficiency (scoring redundant actions), and critical-point adherence / user interaction (missing information, ambiguous tasks, unapproved irreversible actions)

The resulting training mix contains roughly 2M samples: ~60% web trajectories, 12.8% synthetic environments, 12.5% form filling, 8.8% grounding, 4.9% VQA, and 0.8% GUI drag tasks.

### Key Capabilities

Fara1.5 can automate everyday web tasks including:
- Searching for information and summarizing results
- Filling out forms and managing accounts
- Booking travel, movie tickets, and restaurant reservations
- Shopping and comparing prices across retailers
- Finding job postings and real estate listings

### Performance Highlights

Each Fara1.5 model sets a new state of the art for its size class. Fara1.5-9B improves over Fara-7B by +29.3 points on Online-Mind2Web, +13.1 points on WebVoyager, and +8.2 points on WebTailBench outcome success:

| Model | Size | WebVoyager | Online-Mind2Web | WebTailBench v1.5 (Process) | WebTailBench v1.5 (Outcome) |
|-------|------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Larger and proprietary agents** | | | | | |
| o3 SoM | - | 79.3 | 55.4 | 69.5 | 35.0 |
| GPT-5 SoM | - | 90.6 | 57.7 | 69.2 | 45.1 |
| Gemini 2.5 Computer Use† | - | - | 57.3 | - | - |
| OpenAI Operator† | - | 87.0 | 58.3 | - | - |
| Yutori Navigator (n1)† | - | - | 64.7 | - | - |
| GUI-Owl-1.5† | 32B | 82.0 | - | - | - |
| Holo2† | 30B-A3B | 83.0 | - | - | - |
| **Similarly sized agents** | | | | | |
| Fara-7B | 7B | 73.5 | 34.1 | 48.8 | 24.1 |
| MolmoWeb† | 8B | 78.2 | 35.3 | - | - |
| Holo2† | 8B | 80.2 | - | - | - |
| GUI-Owl-1.5† | 8B | 78.1 | 48.6 | - | - |
| **Fara1.5 family (ours)** | | | | | |
| **Fara1.5-4B** | 4B | 80.8 | 57.3 | 60.3 | 27.4 |
| **Fara1.5-9B** | 9B | 86.6 | 63.4 | 64.5 | 32.3 |
| **Fara1.5-27B** | 27B | **89.3** | **72.3** | 72.9 | 40.2 |
| FaraGen1.5 Solver (GPT-5.4) | - | 93.4 | 83.4 | 79.6 | 57.4 |

*Table: Task success rate (%) on WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, and WebTailBench v1.5. For WebTailBench v1.5 we report both Process Success (correct intermediate steps) and Outcome Success (final task state correct). All Fara1.5 and Fara-7B numbers are averaged over three independent runs. The GPT-5.4-based FaraGen1.5 solver is an upper-bound reference for the SFT-based distillation. † denotes numbers sourced from the model's official release or leaderboard rather than re-run by us.*

### WebTailBench: Evaluating Real-World Web Tasks

**[WebTailBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/WebTailBench)** is our evaluation benchmark focusing on 11 real-world task types that are underrepresented or missing in existing benchmarks. The benchmark includes 609 tasks across diverse categories, with the first 8 segments testing single skills or objectives (usually on a single website), and the remaining 3 evaluating more difficult multi-step or cross-site tasks (shopping lists, comparison shopping, and compositional tasks). Tasks and precomputed rubrics are on Hugging Face (use the refreshed `test_v2` split), the **Universal Verifier** (`MMRubricAgent`) is the official judge, and the reproducibility CLI lives in `webeval/scripts/webtailbench.py`.

### CUAVerifierBench: Evaluating the Verifiers Themselves

While WebTailBench measures *agents*, **[CUAVerifierBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/CUAVerifierBench)** measures the *judges that score those agents*. Each row pairs a Fara agent trajectory (instruction, screenshots, web_surfer log, final answer) with one human reviewer's verdict, plus the verdicts produced by the **Universal Verifier (`MMRubricAgent`)** and several legacy verifiers — so researchers can compute verifier–human agreement (Cohen's κ, accuracy, F1) on a fixed corpus and iterate on new judge prompts / architectures against a frozen ground-truth set.

The dataset is exposed as two Hugging Face configs joinable on `task_id`:

| Config | Granularity | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `trajectories` | one row per task | instruction, screenshots, web_surfer log, verifier outputs, task-level human aggregates |
| `annotations` | one row per (task, judge) | per-reviewer outcome / process labels and free-text justifications |

Two splits ship today:

| Split | Source | Trajectories | Annotation rows |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fara7b_om2w_browserbase` | Fara-7B trajectories on Online-Mind2Web tasks executed via Browserbase | 106 | 215 (≈2 reviewers/task; UV-blind **and** UV-informed stages) |
| `internal` | Heldout aurora-v2 task suite scored with the same WebSurfer + verifier stack | 154 | 154 (1 reviewer/task; UV-blind only) |

Reviewer identities are anonymized as `Judge1` … `JudgeN` using a single shared map across both splits. The build script that produced the dataset (with full schema + provenance) ships alongside the data on Hugging Face at [`microsoft/CUAVerifierBench`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/CUAVerifierBench); see the [dataset README](https://huggingface.co/datasets/microsoft/CUAVerifierBench/blob/main/README.md) for the full column list.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

trajs = load_dataset("microsoft/CUAVerifierBench", "trajectories",
                     split="fara7b_om2w_browserbase")
anns  = load_dataset("microsoft/CUAVerifierBench", "annotations",
                     split="fara7b_om2w_browserbase")
```

### Evaluation Infrastructure

Our evaluation setup leverages:

1. **Playwright** - A cross-browser automation framework that replicates browser environments
2. **Abstract Web Agent Interface** - Allows integration of any model from any source into the evaluation environment
3. **Fara-Agent Class** - Reference implementation for running the Fara models

> **Note:** Fara1.5 is a research preview designed to invite hands-on exploration and feedback from the community. We recommend running it in a sandboxed environment, monitoring its execution, and avoiding sensitive data or high-risk domains.

## Installation


### Linux 

The following instructions are for Linux systems, see the Windows section below for Windows instructions. 

Install the package using pip and set up the environment with Playwright:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fara.git
cd fara

# 2. Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv 
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[vllm]
playwright install
```

Note: If you plan on hosting with Microsoft Foundry only, you can skip the `[vllm]` and just do `pip install -e .`


### Windows

For Windows, we highly recommend using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to provide a Linux-like environment. However, if you prefer to run natively on Windows, follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/fara.git
cd fara

# 2. Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -e .
python3 -m playwright install
```

### Hosting the Model

**Recommended:** The easiest way to get started is using Microsoft Foundry hosting, which requires no GPU hardware or model downloads. All three Fara1.5 models are available on Foundry.

#### Microsoft Foundry Hosting

Deploy Fara1.5 models from the Microsoft Foundry catalog ([Fara1.5-4B](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-4B-foundry), [Fara1.5-9B](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-9B-foundry), [Fara1.5-27B](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-27B-foundry)) without needing to download weights or manage GPU infrastructure.

**Setup:**

1. Deploy the model on Microsoft Foundry and obtain your endpoint URL and API key

Then create a endpoint configuration JSON file (e.g., `azure_foundry_config.json`):

```json
{
    "model": "Fara1.5-9B",
    "base_url": "https://your-endpoint.inference.ml.azure.com/",
    "api_key": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
}
```

2. Run the Fara agent:

```bash
fara-cli --task "how many pages does wikipedia have" --endpoint_config azure_foundry_config.json [--headful]
```

Note: you can also specify the endpoint config with the args `--base_url [your_base_url] --api_key [your_api_key] --model [your_model_name]` instead of using a config JSON file. 

Note: If you see an error that the `fara-cli` command is not found, then try:

```bash
python -m fara.run_fara --task "what is the weather in new york now"
```

That's it! No GPU or model downloads required.

#### Self-hosting with vLLM

If you have access to GPU resources, you can download the model weights from [Hugging Face](https://aka.ms/fara1.5-hf), self-host Fara models with vLLM, and point `fara-cli` at the resulting OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

```bash
vllm serve <model> --port 5000 --dtype auto
```

The previous-generation [Fara-7B](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Fara-7b) weights remain available on Hugging Face (with [GGUF variants](https://huggingface.co/bartowski/microsoft_Fara-7B-GGUF) for LM Studio / Ollama). Pass `--fara-7b` to run the Fara-7B agent instead of Fara1.5:

```bash
fara-cli --fara-7b --task "how many pages does wikipedia have" --endpoint_config fara7b_config.json
```

If you didn't use vLLM to host, specify `--base_url [your_base_url] --api_key [your_api_key] --model [your_model_name]` when running `fara-cli`. Please ensure that context length is set to at least 15000 tokens and temperature to 0 for best results.

Runs save a full trajectory — per-step screenshots and a `data_point.json` (task, actions, observations, and outcome) — to the folder passed via `--output_folder`.

## Reproducibility

Instructions to reproduce our benchmark results (WebVoyager, Online-Mind2Web, WebTailBench) with the `webeval/` framework — including installation, the per-benchmark CLIs, BrowserBase setup, and result analysis — live in [`docs/eval_reproducibility.md`](docs/eval_reproducibility.md).

> **Note:** the webeval pipeline documented there produced the previous-generation (Fara-7B) numbers and is being updated for the Fara1.5 evaluation stack.
